Hi Everyone!

This folder contains the source code of the Countdown Timer.
It works straightforward in which the user should only enter the desired time in seconds. 

This is a simple project in python that makes you get your hands dirty with the fundamentals in Python. Feel free to use it if you're new to Python, and if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me.

Best,

Mohammad Fattahi
