Hi Everyone!

This folder contains the source code of the FizzBuzz game. Here is the problem description: 

''' Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” 
instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples 
of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”. '''

Feel free to use it if you're new to Python, and if you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask me.

Best,

Mohammad Fattahi
